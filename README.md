# Online Machine Learning LabScripts
These are a collection of code created from the labs mainly kept on here for bookwork as it is easier for me to switch between my laptop and desktop using git hub. There is also a folder titled Machine_Learning_Report in which a report written in latex summarising key algorithms in the course was started. The folder titled Coursework contains two subfolders titled Hidden Markov Model and Aggregating Algorithm.

The Hidden Markov Model part of the coursework involved implement a function to calculate the alpha, beta and gamma coefficients for a hidden Markov model with 12 hidden states and 10 observable states.

The Aggregating Algorithm part of the coursework involved implementing a function to calculate predictions output by the Aggregating Algo-
rithms with equal weights in the binary square loss (Brier) game. This was done with the tennis data [here.](http://vovk.net/ICML2008/) Details of the file can also be found using the link.

A brief outline of the course used to learn the material is included below.
